## Easier text markup

Jekyll can use [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) for marking… up text. It has a special *syntax* that is *parsed* into basic HTML, instead of manually writing it all out by hand.

<!-- Note the inline link. -->

---

It’s used by *many, many* things now: [Google chats][chats], [Slack][slack], [Reddit][reddit], [GitHub][github], [Are.na][arena], [Notion][notion], etc. Sometimes they have their own *flavors* that add special syntax, but the base stuff is the same. Often [WYSIWYG][wysiwyg] text editors are just adding Markdown syntax around things!

<!-- Compared to these “reference style” ones. -->

- It’s often **much easier** to read the source.
- It is usually much quicker to write.
- Your changes (Git’s `diff`) are clear.
- And overall it is less error-prone.

…compared to writing all the elements/tags yourself! Markdown does have to be compiled/parsed out into HTML, but a lot of software does this behind the scenes.

> I *love* Markdown. If there is only one thing you take away from our class, let it be some fluency in `.md`. It’s the [lingua franca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingua_franca) for basic text formatting.
